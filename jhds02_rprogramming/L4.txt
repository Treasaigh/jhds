str function
	str: compactly display the internal structure of an object (diagnostic, similar to summary, see what is in an object)
		goal: one line per object to answer what's in this object?
		RStudio: basis for the environment panel
Simulation
	functions: rnorm, dnorm, pnorm, rpois
	gen random numbers: d density, r random, p cumulative, q quantile
		args: specify the mean and sigma or will default to 0,1
		set.seed: seed the random number psuedo to make repreducible, can be any integer
	gen poisson variables: use cumulative dist to eval probabilities
	gen random numbers from linear model, binomial, generalized (poisson)
	sampling: draw randomly from set of objects, random order of vector, with or without replacement
R Profiler
	profiler: when code takes a long time, help figure out why and optimize
		slow: examine how much time in different parts, code is fast on its own but then looped many times
		optimizing: function first, readibility, then use profiling to find optimization ideas
	tools
		system.time(): eval expression passed, can be many lines, returns time to execute (user/CPU, elapsed total wall clock time)
			parallel: package to use multiple cores
			BLAS: multi-thread libraries to use multi-processors
			beyond: assumes you know where to look, works best on smaller programs
		Rprof(): starts the profiler, sample at 0.02 secs, summaryRprof() makes output more readable
			process: keeps track of call stack, tabulate how often each part spends
			raw: lists of calls, read right to left
			summaryRprof(): by.total and by.self to tabulate the time at each level, also sample.interval, sampling.time
	Summary: help performance analysis, breaks code to get good profilers info, C/Fortran not profiled if called
Scoping Rules (part 3)
	application optimization: optimization routines require pass of function
		constructor: make fucntion to be optimized, with data elements specified to not have to call data params each time
		plot likelihood: fix variable and plot var to be optimized, apply function across params
	lexical scoping: can build objective functions with everything needed to specify built-in to environment
