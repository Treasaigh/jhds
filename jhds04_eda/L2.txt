Lattice
	use: high dimension, amny plots at once easily
	lattice: package, with grid for low level plumbing, one-phase where everything is all in a single function
	functions: xyplot, bwplot, histogram, stripplot, dotplot, splom, levelplot, contourplot
		formula notation: ~ for function expression
		conditioning: interactions between, uses |
		data: DF where variables are found
	behavior: don't plot directly, return trellis class, data then goes to graphics device to auto-print to send to grpahics
	Panel Functions: controls what happens in each panel, receive x/y coordinates of their panel
	Example: MAACS study, how does indoor allergen vary over time
	Summary: single function, margins and spacing are auto-handled, ideal for condition plots on many vars, panel to customize each panel at once
ggplot2
	what: package, grammar of graphics, description of breakng down graphics into concepts like language (words, nouns, verbs, adjectives)
		modes: first (base), second (lattice), third (ggplot2)
		grammar: mapping from aestetic to geometric objects, make it easy to get there
	basics
		plot(): DF data, made up of aesthetics (size, shape, color) and geoms (points, lines)
		factors: indicate subsets of data, should be labeled
			qplot(): hides what goes on underneath
			ggplot(): core function and very flexible to do many intense things
		Example: mpg internal package
			facets: make multiple panels by some factor var (rows ~ cols)
		Example: MAACS Cohort
			density smooth: smooth hitogram into line smoothed
	ggplot()
		grammar: abstract representation for graphics, language for graphics
		components: dataframe, aesthetic mapping, geoms, facets, stats, scales, coordinate system
		building: artist palatte model, start with something and build pieces, layers (plot data, overlay summary, meta/annotate)
			summary(): call on plot, can see some structure elements
			facet_something(): vars as (var1 ~ var2) or (. ~ var2) to deault none as .
			labels: facet will use the data/meta to lable the facets, make graphic much easier
			annotate: xlab(), ylab(), labs(), ggtitle(), geom function options, theme()
			alpha: control transparency inside geom
			color: can be assigned a constant or a factor variable (have to wrap in aes())
			labs(): modify labels with params
		axis limits: use xlim and ylim params (pulls data point from source), or coord_cartesian() to change the frame of the graphic
		Example: more complex
			cut(): bin data into ranges to make factor vars out of continuous
