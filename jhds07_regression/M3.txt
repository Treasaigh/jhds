Generalized Linear Models
	Linear Models: most useful applied statistical technique (documentation of limitations)
	GLM: 3 components, exponential family model, systematic component, link function
		Example: logistic regression on addititive error linear model
			logit: log trans of the odds (mean/1-mean)
			posson regression: breakdown of components and likelihood
		Note: don't need full data, only canonical link functions
	Variances: function of the linear predictor
	Odds and Ends: iterative solvency, predicted responses, 1 unit increase holding coefficients constant
Binary GLM Examples
	logistic regression: interpret as odds ratio based on predictor (points scored in Ravens NFL example)
		function: manipulate to investigate what the params affect in the probability odds function
		exponentiate: take the exp() of the coefficients to pull back out of log scale and get odds
	ANOVA: test of model fit for nested models.
	Interpret Odds Ratios: not probability, relate to gambling to make easy to interpret, relative
		Retrospective Studies: relative scale for following conditions (long term effects of lung cancer)
Poisson GLM Examples
	Distribution: models counts and rates, examples, rate count per monitoring time
	Examples: plots of poisson with different lambdas
		Example: web hits per day
